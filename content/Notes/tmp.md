Noyaev said on Facebook, "First of all, I want to clarify that the Russians are not cowards. Beginners usually train on the top of their own warehouses. This height will not pose any threat to the Russians. "In fact, not all Russians can understand the ambition of the roof to the horizon, and hesitate to hesitate to take the final step."

In the jargon, it is the brown bear soul in their body that has not yet been potted. At this time, other Russian that has been awakened is needed to spread the last salt.

The executors are usually their closest friends, imagining that they are the white clouds of Leningrad, and they can walk to the sky with their friends' arms.
