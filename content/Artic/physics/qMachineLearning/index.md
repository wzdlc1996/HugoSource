summary: "Quantum machine learning is the integration of quantum algorithms within machine learning programs. Generally, we have four different approaches for this purpose, by the type of data (quantum state/data or classical data) and type of algorithm or platform (quantum algorithm/computer or classical algorithm/computer). In this report, we will discuss the current state of quantum machine learning, and the potential application and further development in the NISQ(Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era."

# Data Science and Machine Learning

Formally, **Data science** is an **inter-disciplinary** field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract **knowledge** and insights from many structural and unstructured data[Wikipedia/Data_science](1). The core object of research in this field is data for the goal of knowledge. This approach is different from research of mathematics and common theoretical study by deductive reasoning.
