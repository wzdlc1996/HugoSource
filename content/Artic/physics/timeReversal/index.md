summary: "Time reversal symmetry is one of the fundamental requirement of most physics theories. However, it is also one of the most strange concepts in the physics, since there is no one can make an experiment to implement the time reversal procedure. In this note, we will discuss how time reversal is introduced in physics and what we actually mean by mentioning it. The note covers the time reversal in classical mechanics and its representation in quantum theory. Some essential mathematical knowledge is required but can be found in Notes/qm."

# Time Reversal in Physics

## Introduction

In the historical view, the time reversal is firstly presented in the regime of classical motion of massive objects. A slightly modern model (but tricky) to understand it can be a rewind video. Imagine a ball falling freely and we record its motion, the rewind version of it will not make you feel wired. You may think that there is someone who throw it up from a lower height. **Time reversal** means such the transformation, we do not have a clear definition yet, which can map a motion to its rewind version. 

Before further digging in this concept, let us do some critics to the understanding above. 

1.  To rewind the motion one needs the motion last `finite` temporal interval. 

    It is usually prefered by theoretists that a concept or theory should be defined `locally`. For example, Newton's law of motion can help us get to know the future motion as long as we know the forces and instant state (position and momentum). This understanding based on rewind limits our discussion in a duration of motion, i.e., non-local. This property makes it hard to use. 

2.  Time reversal is `more` than the rewind of `re-order the stages during motion`. 

    The word "stage during motion" is ambiguous here. In the sense of completely description of the configuration, each stage should be a group of real numbers for the positions of objects. Rewind just returns the time series of such stages in the reversed order. But once we notice that we should use position and momentum together in the dynamics, such re-ordering is different from the time reversal. 
    Moreover, in the modern physics, it is necessary to handle the motion of many new concepts like spin. Generally, they may have no correspondance like that velocity is actually the time direvative of position thus its sign should change.
