# Introduction

# Circuit Complexity

In this part, we review the work of ([Eisert 2021][1])), where the circuit complexity is defined and a lower bound named as entangling power is proved. 

## Circuit Complexity and Cost

In the circuit model, we measure the complexity of a given unitary operator by the number of elementary gates it consumes. This intuition is generalized here. For a given unitary operator generated by a set "normalized operator basis" $\{\hat O_j\}_{j=1}^{J}$, i.e., 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat U &= \mathcal{T}\exp \Big( - \ti \int_0^1 \hat H(s) \td s \Big) 
\end{aligned},
$$

where $\hat H(s) = \sum_{j=1}^N y_j(s) \hat O_j \ ; \ \|\hat O_j\| = 1$ and the time-order exponential function is defined as in ([wikipedia/ordered_exponential][2]). The basis $\hat O_j$, for example, in the qubit model we can choose the set of all two-local operators. The matrix norm can be any legal norm. This unitary operator can be approximated by the product of infinitesimal time evolution. Then we define the cost by the "query times" of basis.

_[Definition]_: (Circuit cost). For a given set $\{\hat O_1,\cdots,\hat O_J\}$ in the Lie algebra of $d^n$-dimension (where $d$ is the dimension of local unit(qubit $d=2$) and $n$ is the number of units) $su(d^n)$ of **traceless** Hermitian matrix normalized as $\|\hat O_j\|=1$. The cost of unitary operator $\hat U$ is the infimum 

$$
C(\hat U) := \inf \int_0^1 \td s \ \sum_{j=1}^J |y_j(s)|,
$$

over all continuous functions $y_j: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ so that $\hat U = \mathcal{T}\exp\Big( - \ti \int_0^1 \hat H(s) \td s \Big)$ and $\hat H= \sum_{j=1}^N y_j(s) \hat O_j$ are satisfied. Note $\hat O_j$s are traceless since the constant term contributes a global phase.
