# Introduction

# Circuit Complexity and Entanglement

In this part, we review the work of ([Eisert 2021][1])), where the circuit complexity is defined and a lower bound named as entangling power is proved. 

## Circuit Complexity and Cost

In the circuit model, we measure the complexity of a given unitary operator by the number of elementary gates it consumes. This intuition is generalized here. For a given unitary operator generated by a set "normalized operator basis" $\{\hat O_j\}_{j=1}^{J}$, i.e., 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat U &= \mathcal{T}\exp \Big( - \ti \int_0^1 \hat H(s) \td s \Big) 
\end{aligned},
$$

where $\hat H(s) = \sum_{j=1}^J y_j(s) \hat O_j \ ; \ \|\hat O_j\| = 1$ and the time-order exponential function is defined as in ([wikipedia/ordered_exponential][2]). The basis $\hat O_j$, for example, in the qubit model we can choose the set of all two-local operators. The matrix norm can be any legal norm. This unitary operator can be approximated by the product of infinitesimal time evolution. Then we define the cost by the "query times" of basis.

_[Definition]_: (Circuit cost). For a given set $\{\hat O_1,\cdots,\hat O_J\}$ in the Lie algebra of $d^n$-dimension (where $d$ is the dimension of local unit(qubit $d=2$) and $n$ is the number of units) $\mathfrak{su}(d^n)$ of **traceless** Hermitian matrix normalized as $\|\hat O_j\|=1$. The cost of unitary operator $\hat U \in SU(d^n)$ is the infimum 

$$
C(\hat U) := \inf \int_0^1 \td s \ \sum_{j=1}^J |y_j(s)|,
$$

over all continuous functions $y_j: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ so that $\hat U = \mathcal{T}\exp\Big( - \ti \int_0^1 \hat H(s) \td s \Big)$ and $\hat H= \sum_{j=1}^N y_j(s) \hat O_j$ are satisfied. Note $\hat O_j$s are traceless since the constant term contributes a global phase. 

<!--
{{< fold "Case of su(2)" >}}

As the simplest case, we consider the situation of $n=1, d=2$, i.e., the unitary operator in $U(2)$. This is also the complexity of single qubit gates. 

The generic form of $2\times 2$ unitary operator reads (up to a global phase or $U(1)$ freedom.)

$$
\bm{U} = \begin{bmatrix}
u & v \\
-v^* & u^*
\end{bmatrix} \ \textrm{in which} \ |u|^2 + |v|^2 = 1.
$$

With the embedding of Bloch sphere, any $\bm{U}$ corresponds to a rotation on the Bloch sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, according to the relation of

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bm{U} &= e^{-\ti \sum_{i=1}^3 x^i \sigma^i} = \bm{I} \cos \|\bm{x}\|_2 - \ti \frac {\bm{x}\cdot \bm{\sigma}} {\|\bm{x}\|_2} \sin \|\bm{x}\|_2 \\
&\sim e^{-\ti 2\theta \bm{n}\cdot \bm{J}} = \tilde{\bm{U}} \in SO(3)
\end{aligned},
$$

where $\theta = \|\bm{x}\|_2, \bm{n} = \bm{x} / \|\bm{x}\|_2$, and $\bm{J}$ is the generator of $\mathfrak{so}(3)$. The relation between these two  representation is, with the Bloch sphere map of

$$
\mathbb{C}^2 \ni \bm{z} = \begin{bmatrix}
e^{-\ti \phi / 2} \cos \frac \theta 2 \\
e^{\ti \phi / 2} \sin \frac \theta 2
\end{bmatrix} \sim (\sin\theta \cos \phi, \sin\theta \sin \phi, \cos\theta) = \tilde{\bm{z}} \in \mathbb{S}^2,
$$

that

$$
\bm{U} \bm{z} \sim \tilde{\bm{U}} \tilde{\bm{z}}.
$$

Thus, with this relation, we can map the approximator driven by $\hat H(s) \in\textrm{span }\mathfrak{su}(2)$ to the linear combination of $\mathfrak{so}(3)$. The latter one has the geometric meaning of infinitesimal rotation in $\mathbb{S}^2$. This fact provides us the equation to compute the cost of any operator in $U(2)$, by the following procedure

1.  Map the unitary operator(matrix) $\hat U$ to the rotation on $\mathbb{S}^2$, described as $(\bm{n}, \theta)$ with axis $\bm{n}$ and angle $\theta$,
2.  Find the corresponding rotation generator $\{\bm{n}_j\}$ of the given set $\{\hat O_j\}$.
3.  Find the best approximation of $(\bm{n}, \theta)$ by $\{\bm{R}_j\}$ as the product of a sequence of infinitesimal rotation

    $$
    (\bm{n},\theta) = \lim_{\min\{\delta\theta_i\}\rightarrow 0}\prod_{i=1}^N (\bm{n}_i,\delta \theta_i).
    $$

    The "best" means the arc length $s = \sum_i \delta \theta_i$ is minimized over all possible approximation. Note this arc length is different from usual definition in geometry, this is the role of the restricted generator set $\{\hat O_j\}$. In the limit of $\delta\theta_i \rightarrow 0$, ordered exponential of operators(matrix) returns to the product up to a higher order error, like the circuit decomposition. 
4.  The circuit complexity 

    $$
    C(\hat U) = \frac 1 2 s.
    $$

    The factor $s$ comes from the relation between $\theta \bm{n}\cdot\bm{\sigma} \rightarrow 2\theta \bm{n} \cdot \bm{J}$, since the norm of Pauli matrices and generator $\bm{J}$ are $1$. Common generators of $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ has the norm of $1/2$. 

Then to find the circuit cost of a unitary operator in $U(2)$ need us to find the decomposition along given axes of a 3-D rotation with minimum sum of rotation angles.

_[Definition]_: (Potential Entangling Power) A unitary operator $\hat U \in SU(d^2)$ has the potential entangling power 

$$
e(\hat U) := \log(d) \min\{\|\hat H\|: \hat U = e^{-\ti \hat H} , \hat H^\dagger = \hat H\}.
$$

{{< fold "Entangling Power and Entanglement" >}}

Here we make a brief discussion about the relation between potential entangling power $e(\hat U)$ and the commonly used entanglement: the von-Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix with respect to the separation of system. 

Consider the initial state $\hat \rho = \hat \rho_A \otimes \hat \rho_B$, under the unitary operator $\hat U$, the entanglement generation is the difference between the entropy:

$$
\Delta S = S(\textrm{Tr}_B \hat U \hat \rho \hat U^\dagger) = -\textrm{Tr}_A\Big(\hat \rho' \log \rho'\Big)\Big|_{\hat \rho' = \textrm{Tr}_B \hat U \hat \rho \hat U^\dagger}.
$$

If $e(\hat U)$ gets small, for example, consider $\hat U = e^{-\ti \epsilon \hat H}$ with $\|\hat H\|=\textrm{Const}$ and $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat \rho' \approx \textrm{Tr}_B (1-\ti\epsilon \hat H) \hat \rho (1+\ti \epsilon \hat H) = \hat \rho_A + \ti \epsilon \textrm{Tr}_B [\hat \rho, \hat H] + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2).
\end{aligned}
$$

The entropy of the leading order term vanishes, thus when $e(\hat U)$ is small, the entanglement generation will also be expected to be small. When $e(\hat U)\rightarrow 0$, it should be converging to zero. 

However, for finite $e(\hat U)$, the relation between potential entangling power and entanglement generation is still not obvious.

## Entanglement Bounds Circuit Costs

For convenience, the following notation is introduced. The system is decomposed into 1-D "chain" spatially: $\{1,\cdots,n\}$. When the locality of operators is not covered, such decomposition is generic by re-encoding as 1-D array. The entanglement entropy of the cut $s\in\{1,\cdots,n-1\}$ reads

$$
E(\hat \rho; s) := S(\textrm{Tr}_{\{s+1,\cdots,n\}} \hat \rho).
$$

i.e., this cuts the system into two parts of $\{1,\cdots,s\}$ and $\{s+1,\cdots,n\}$. 

### Entanglement lower bounds the cost

_[Theorem]_: The circuit cost of $\hat U\in SU(d^n)$ is lower bounded by potentially entanglement power

$$
C(\hat U) \geq \frac 1 {c n \log d} \max_s \frac {E(\hat U \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}\hat U^\dagger ; s)} {\min(s,n-s)} ,
$$

where $\ket{\psi} = \bigotimes_{r=1}^n \ket{\phi_i}$ is a product state.

{{< fold "Proof" >}}

With the Trotter's decomposition, we can approximate $\hat U$ with any precision as

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat U &\approx \prod_{k=1}^N e^{-\frac \ti N \sum_{j=1}^J y_j(k/N)\hat O_j}\\
&\approx \prod_{k=1}^N \Big(e^{-\frac \ti N \frac {y_1(k/N)} m \hat O_1}\cdots e^{-\frac \ti N \frac {y_J(k/N)} m \hat O_J}\Big)^m \\
&= \prod_{k=1}^N\Big(\prod_{j=1}^J \exp\big( - \frac {\ti} {m N} y_j(k/N) \hat O_j\big)\Big)^m
\end{aligned}.
$$

Denoting $\hat V_{k,j}=\exp\big(-\frac \ti N y_j(k/N)\hat O_j \big)$, the second line works by the limit procedure

$$
\hat V_k = e^{-\frac \ti N \sum_{j=1}^J y_j(k/N)\hat O_j} = \lim_{m\rightarrow \infty} \Big(\prod_{j=1}^J \hat V_{k,j}^{1/m} \Big)^m. 
$$

Then we rewrite the quantum state driven by $\hat U$ into a time-dependent form as

$$
\ket{\psi_l} = \prod_{k=1}^l \hat V_k \ket{\psi}.
$$

Note that we do not specify the order of operator product here since reverse the order (by $\prod_{k=1}^l \rightarrow \prod_{k=N}^{N-l+1}$) is equivalent to substitute the function $y$ as $y(s) \rightarrow y(1-s)$. 

Now we use the result in ([S. Bravyi 2007][3])(Sec. II), which proves

> Denote $d=\min \{\dim A, \dim B\}$, then there exists a constant $c$ such that
$$
\frac {\td } {\td t} S(\textrm{Tr}_B e^{-\ti \hat H t} \hat \rho e^{\ti \hat H t}) \Bigg| _{t=0} =\mathcal{O}(\|\hat H\| \log d) .
$$

This result also provides the relation between the entanglement generation and the potential entanglement power. $e(\hat U)$ controls the initial infinitesimal entropy generation rate. The proof is straightforward as 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\delta S(x) &= S(x+\delta x) - S(x) \\
&= - \textrm{Tr}\Big((x+\delta x) \log (x+\delta x)\Big) + \textrm{Tr} x\log x \\
&= -\textrm{Tr}\Big((1+\log x) \delta x\Big) + \mathcal{O}(\delta x^2)
\end{aligned}
$$

Then the entanglement generation

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac {\td } {\td t} S(\textrm{Tr}_B e^{-\ti \hat H t}\hat \rho e^{\ti \hat H t}) \Bigg| _{t=0} &= -\textrm{Tr}\Big(\Big)
\end{aligned}
$$

With this result, one has (noting $\hat V_k$ is the infinitesimal Hamiltonian driven)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& E(\ket{\psi_{l}}\bra{\psi_{l}}; s) - E(\ket{\psi_{l-1}}\bra{\psi_{l-1}}; s) \\
=& E(\hat V_l \ket{\psi_{l-1}}\bra{\psi_{l-1}}\hat V_l^\dagger;s) - E(\ket{\psi_{l-1}}\bra{\psi_{l-1}}; s) \\
\approx& \sum_{k=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^J \Delta f(\hat V_{l, j}^{1/m}) \ \ \textrm{omitting state dependence} \\
=& m \sum_{j=1}^J \frac 1 m \mathcal{O} \Big(\|\hat O_j\|\log d^{\min(s, n-s)}\Big) \frac {|y_j(l/N)|} N \\
\leq & \min(s, n-s)\times  \frac {c \log d} {N}  \sum_{j=1}^J |y_j(l/N)|
\end{aligned}.
$$

Then sum over $l=1,\cdots,N$, with the summation approximation for the integral, we have

$$
E(\hat U\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}\hat U ; s) - E(\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}; s) \leq \min(s, n-s) c\log d \times C(\hat U).
$$

The initial state $\ket{\psi}$ and cut $s$ are arbitrary. When it is a product state, we get the form in the theorem.
