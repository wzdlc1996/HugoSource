summary: "Time in quantum mechanics is always left as an parameter in the equation of motion. In the non-relativistic quantum theory we find time in the derivative of wavefunction, while in the relativistic quantum field theory, it is not at the same status of spatial position: we introduce the space-time dependent field operator only for Lorentz covariance for the equation of motion. Whether can we have an intrinsic interpretation of time flow in quantum mechanics was early discussed by Don Page and William Wootters with the purpose to match the energy superselection rule. Though it may not be a correct theory for our world or even 'close' to it, it is worthy to discuss in modern view here as a consistent approach to the time puzzle."

# Introduction

# Page-Wootters Mechanism

ref: the original paper [by Page & Wootters](https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.27.2885)

## Motivation

The motivation of Page and Wootters' work is the **superselection rule** in quantum mechanics (see [wikipedia/Superselection][1] for more information). Simply speaking, superselection rule think the Hamiltonian of the whole universe has a special structure such that some additive physics quantity (as operator) is commute to it. This leads to the Hilbert space of universe can be separated into several sectors. Observers, as the subsystem in the universe, are not allowed to recognize whether the universe is in a coherent superposition of distinct sectors or just a mixture of them. If the initial state of universe is in one sector, then during the time evolution there should be a global conservation rule existing. Wigner might be the first one to consider such observable limitation leading specific conservation rules like the total charge ([Wightman 1995][2]).

Page and Wootters thought there should be also a total energy superselection rule, and the universe should be at some energy eigenstate. By the quantum mechanics, this leads to the stationary picture of the universe dynamics as

$$
\ket{\psi(t): \textrm{universe}} = e^{\ti E t /\hbar} \ket{\psi(0): \textrm{universe}}.
$$

In such case, there should be no "time evolution" and violates our intuition: time flow does exists and we can even check it by experiment. To overcome this issue, Page and Wootters illustrate an interest analysis for closed system and introduced the "clock time" via the entanglement of parties. The "clock time", distinguished from the time $t$ appear in Schrodinger equation as "coordinate time", should be the one we realizable in the real world. This analysis, by their original paper, is "may not true but consistent", is interest and worthy to discuss.
