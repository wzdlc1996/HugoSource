summary: "The first problem we meet in the practice about quantum mechanics is to simulate the quantum time evolution on computer. Formally, it is the numerical simulation of the (time-dependent) Schrodinger Equation. In this review, we discuss various numerical method for the Schrodinger equation and quantum time evolution, including their implementation and error analysis."
