summary: "Wigner's theorem is essential for the discussion of symmetry in quantum mechanics. It makes a link between the symmetry transforms of space of distinct quantum states (as elements in complex projective space) and the unitary transforms on the Hilbert space. We are going to follow different approaches of the proof. The discussion of different types of Hilbert space(separable and inseparable) is also covered."

Wigner treat the physical states as **unit rays** in the Hilbert space. A unit ray is a set of normalized wavefunctions up to a global phase factor, as

$$
\psi = \{e^{\ti \alpha} \ket{\psi} : \alpha \in \mathbb{R}\}\ .
$$

A unit ray denotes a specific physical state. The prediction within quantum mechanics is in term of transition probability between two unit rays, i.e., the only measurable quantity in quantum mechanics is of

$$
S_{ij} = |(\psi_i,\psi_j)|^2 = |\braket{\psi_i|\psi_j}|^2\ .
$$

Thus, he defined the symmetry transformation as a set of one-to-one maps between unit rays with such quantity invariant, i.e., transform conserves the magnitude of overlap.

To test a given symmetry transformation is of unitary or antiunitary, a function is introduced as([V. Bargmann 1964][2])

$$
\forall \ket{\psi_1},\ket{\psi_2},\ket{\psi_3}\in\mathcal{H}, \Delta(\psi_1,\psi_2,\psi_3) = \braket{\psi_1|\psi_2}\braket{\psi_2|\psi_3}\braket{\psi_3|\psi_1}.
$$

One can find function $\Delta$ independent of the global phases of $\ket{\psi_{1,2,3}}$, thus we denote it as a function of unit rays. Now let us admit Wigner's theorem temporarily, the operator $\hat V$ is compatible with $T$, under it the function $\Delta$ transforms as

$$
\Delta(T\psi_1,T\psi_2,T\psi_3) = \prod_{c.y.c.}\braket{\psi_i|\hat V^\dagger \hat V|\psi_j} = \chi(\Delta(\psi_1,\psi_2,\psi_3)).
$$

Function $\chi:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ acts according to the property of $T$: if $T$ is corresponding unitary operator, $\chi$ is an identity; if $T$ is corresponding antiunitary operator, then by $\braket{\psi|\hat V^\dagger \hat V|\psi'} = \braket{\psi|\psi'}^*$, $\chi$ should return the conjugation of its argument. This can also explain why the case of $\dim\mathcal{H}=1$ is special: in this case $\Delta$ should be constantly $1$, thus unitary and antiunitary are the same. While for $\dim\mathcal{H}\gt 1$, for example, in a two-dimensional subspace of $\textrm{span}\{\ket{\psi_2}, \ket{\psi'}\}$ with $\braket{\psi'|\psi_2} = 0$, letting $\ket{\psi_3} = (\ket{\psi_2} + \ti \ket{\psi'})/\sqrt{2}$ and $\ket{\psi_1} = (\ket{\psi_2}+\ket{\psi'})/\sqrt{2}$, we have $\Delta = (1-\ti) / 2^{3/2} \notin \mathbb{R}$, thus in high dimension case these two branches of unitary and antiunitary are not the same.

Now, let us begin the proof of Wigner's theorem. We prove it in three stages

1.  For 1 dimensional case, i.e., $\mathcal{H} = \textrm{span}\{\ket{e}\}$. With $T e = e'$ we can simply define $\hat V_1 (\alpha\ket{e}) = \alpha \ket{e}$ and $\hat V_2 (\alpha\ket{e}) = \alpha^* \ket{e}$. Such operators $\hat V_1, \hat V_2$ are obviously compatible with $T$. $\hat V_1$ is unitary and $\hat V_2$ is antiunitary. 
2.  For countable dimensional cases, i.e., $\dim\mathcal{H} = N \leq |\mathbb{N}|$ (rigorously, $\mathcal{H}$ is [separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_space). Generally $N$ is not a natural number, but due to the nice property of separable Hilbert space (countable dimension), we handle it as a number.), the proof requires a lemma reads ([V. Bargmann 1964][2])

    _[Lemma]_: $\forall \ket{x} \in \mathcal{H}$ with decomposition $\ket{x} = \sum_{i=1}^N x_i \ket{\psi_i}$ and corresponding unit ray $x$, we have

    $$
    \forall x' \in Tx\rightarrow \ket{x'} = \sum_{i=1}^N x'_i \ket{\psi'_i},
    $$

    where $|x'_i| = |x_i|$, $\{\ket{\psi_i}\}$ is a set of orthonormal basis and $\{\ket{\psi'_i} \in T\psi_i\}$ are the orthonormal basis in $\mathcal{H'}$ generated by the image under transform. 

    _[Proof]_: Note that by the definition of symmetric transform (conserves the transition probability), $\{\ket{\psi_i'}\}$ is also a set of orthonormal basis. One can find this by

    $$
    |\braket{\psi_i'|\psi_j'}| = |(T\psi_i,T\psi_j)| = \delta_{ij}.
    $$

    With the phase factor chosen properly, the orthonormal basis in $\mathcal{H'}$ can then be determined. With the property, we have:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \Big\|\ket{x'} - \sum_{i=1}^N x_i' \ket{\psi'_i}\Big\|^2 &= \braket{x'|x'} - \sum_{i,j=1}^N  |\braket{\psi_i'|x'}|^2  \\
    &= |(Tx,Tx)| - \sum_{i,j=1}^N |(T\psi_i, Tx)|^2 \\
    &=\braket{x|x} - \sum_{i,j=1}^N |x_i|^2 \\
    &= \Big\|\ket{x} - \sum_{i=1}^N x_i \ket{\psi_i}\Big\|^2 = 0 .
    \end{aligned} 
    $$
    
    q.e.d.

    Note that we do not assume $\ket{x}$ and $\ket{x'}$ are normalized, the only property we used is $\braket{x|x}\geq 0$, which is required by the definition of inner product in Hilbert space. Thus, once we entend the definition of **unit ray** into **ray**, i.e., $\psi = \{c\ket{\psi}: c\in\mathbb{C}\}$ with other definition like $T$ invariant, this lemma also holds. 
    <br />
    Now, let us construct the corresponding $\hat V$ step by step.

    1.  Find a pair of (normalized) elements $\ket{e}\in\mathcal{H}, \ket{e'}\in \mathcal{H'}$, such that $\ket{e'} \in T e$. Define the behavior of operator $\hat V$ on $\ket{e}$ as:

        $$
        \hat V\ket{e} = \ket{e'}.
        $$
    
    2.  For a subset of $\mathcal{H}$, i.e., those whose orthogonal decompositions have the property of

        $$
        \ket{x} = \ket{e} + \beta \ket{u},
        $$

        in which $\braket{e|u} = 0, \braket{u|u}=1$. With the lemma, if we treat $\{\ket{e}, \ket{u}\}$ as the basis of a two dimensional subspace, we get the requirement of image of $\ket{x}$ under $\hat V$ to be

        $$
        Tx \ni \ket{x'} = \hat V\ket{x} = \ket{e'} + \beta' \ket{u'} \Leftrightarrow |\beta'| = |\beta|, \ket{u'} \in Tu\cap \mathcal{P'}.
        $$

        Note this is not a complete definition for $\hat V$ on this subset, since the map from $\beta\ket{u}$ to $\beta'\ket{u'}$ is not clear yet. We can denote this map as $R:\mathcal{P}\rightarrow \mathcal{P'}$ with the relation of

        $$
        \beta\ket{u} \mapsto R(\beta \ket{u}) = \beta'\ket{u'} = \hat V(\ket{x}- \ket{e}).
        $$

        This definition can cover all elements in $\mathcal{P}$ since the generator of $\ket{x} \xrightarrow{\braket{x|e} = 1} \ket{x}-\ket{e} \in \mathcal{P}$ is surjective(actually, bijective). 
    
    3.  Now we turn to analyze the behavior of map $R$. Since $R(\beta\ket{u}) = \beta' \ket{u'}$, we actually find that $R$ implements the map on states in the orthogonal complementary based on the transform of $T$ on rays. Namely,

        $$
        \forall \ket{x} \in x \subset \mathcal{P} \rightarrow R(\ket{x}) \in Tx \subset \mathcal{P'}. 
        $$

        We are going to prove that $R$ has the property of:

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        \textrm{a) } & \forall \ket{x}, \ket{y} \in\mathcal{P}\rightarrow R(\ket{x}+\ket{y}) = R(\ket{x}) + R(\ket{y}) \\
        \textrm{b) } & \forall \ket{x} \in \mathcal{P} \rightarrow R(\lambda\ket{x}) = \chi(\lambda) R(\ket{x}) \\
        \textrm{c) } & \forall \ket{x}, \ket{y} \in \mathcal{P} \rightarrow (R(\ket{x}), R(\ket{y})) = \chi((\ket{x},\ket{y})) = \chi(\braket{x|y})
        \end{aligned}
        $$

        The road to the proof:

        1.  Function $\chi_s(\cdot)$. This is the definition.

            <br />

            In the beginning, we define the function $\chi_s(\cdot)$ as a state-dependent map. Formally, it is given by

            $$
            \forall \ket{s} \in \mathcal{P}\rightarrow R(\lambda \ket{s}) = \chi_s(\lambda) R(\ket{s}).
            $$

            This form of map $R$ is coming from the definition of $R(\beta \ket{u}) = \beta' \ket{u'}$. Additionally, we have $|\lambda| = |\chi_s(\lambda)|$, by the lemma.
        
        2.  Behavior of $\chi_s(\cdot)$. We are going to prove $\textrm{Re}\chi_s(x) = \textrm{Re}(x)$.  

            <br />

            With the definition of map $R$, we have $\hat V (\ket{e} + \lambda\ket{s}) = \ket{e'} + R(\lambda\ket{s}) = \ket{e'} + \chi_s(\lambda)R(\ket{s})$. Then one can write
            
            $$
            \begin{aligned}
            \forall \ket{s_1}, \ket{s_2}\in\mathcal{P}\rightarrow & \\
            |1+\lambda_1^*\lambda_2 \braket{s_1|s_2}|^2 &= |(\ket{e}+\lambda_1\ket{s_1}, \ket{e}+\lambda_2\ket{s_2})|^2\\
            &= |(\hat V(\ket{e}+\lambda_1 \ket{s_1}), \hat V(\ket{e}+\lambda_2\ket{s_2}))|^2 \\
            &= |1+\chi_{s_1}(\lambda_1)^* \chi_{s_2}(\lambda_2) \braket{R s_1|R s_2}|^2
            \end{aligned}
            $$

            Since $R\ket{s} \in Ts$, one has $|\braket{s_1|s_2}|^2 = |\braket{Rs_1|Rs_2}|^2$. Together with the property of $|\lambda| = |\chi_s(\lambda)|$, the equality gets to be
            
            $$
            \textrm{Re }(\lambda_1^* \lambda_2 \braket{s_1|s_2}) = \textrm{Re }\big(\chi_{s_1}(\lambda_1)^* \chi_{s_2}(\lambda_2) \braket{Rs_1| Rs_2}\big) . 
            $$

            Letting $s_1=s_2=s$, we have

            $$
            \textrm{Re }(\lambda_1^* \lambda_2) = \textrm{Re }(\chi_s(\lambda_1)^* \chi_s(\lambda_2)).
            $$

            With the definition of $\chi_s(\cdot)$ as $R(\lambda\ket{s}) = \chi_s(\lambda) R(\ket{s})$, if $\lambda=1$ we have $R(\ket{s}) = \chi_s(1) R(\ket{s}) \Rightarrow \chi_s(1) = 1$. Then letting $\lambda_1=1, \lambda_2=x$, we have

            $$
            \textrm{Re }(x) = \textrm{Re }(\chi_s(x)).
            $$

            q.e.d.

        3.  Extend the defintion of $\chi_s(\cdot)$. 
            
            <br />

            In this part, we are going to the function $\chi_s(x)$ does be the expansion coefficients under the map of $R$. i.e., given the basis $\{\ket{\phi_i}\}$ of $\mathcal{P}$ and the image $\{\ket{\phi'_i}\}$ with $R(\ket{\phi_i}) = \ket{\phi'_i}$, there is

            $$
            R(\sum_i x_i \ket{\phi_i}) = \sum_i x'_i \ket{\phi'_i} = \sum_i \chi_{\phi_i}(x_i)\ket{\phi'_i}.
            $$

            With the lemma above, there is $|x_i'| = |x_i|$. 



        3.  Independence of $\chi_s(\cdot)$ on $s$. We are going to prove $\chi_s(x) =\chi_{s'}(x)$

            <br />





        3.  Linearity(Antilinearity) of $R$. We are going to prove $R(\ket{x}+\ket{y}) = R(\ket{x}) + R(\ket{y})$

            <br />

            Consider $\forall \ket{x}, \ket{y} \in\mathcal{P}$. If $\dim \mathcal{H} = 2$, then $\dim\mathcal{P}=1$ and $\ket{y} = \mu\ket{x}$. In this case, 



    3.  For any vector in $\ket{x}\in\mathcal{H}$, we have the orthogonal decomposition reads

        $$
        \ket{x} = \alpha \ket{e} + \beta \ket{u},
        $$
        in which $\braket{e|u} =0, \braket{u|u}=1$. Then, with the lemma, we treat $\{\ket{e}, \ket{u}\}$ as the orthonormal basis of a two-dimensional subspace, we have:

        $$
        Tx \ni \ket{x'} = \alpha' \ket{e'} + \beta' \hat R\ket{u},
        $$
        in which $|\alpha'|=|\alpha|, |\beta'|=|\beta|, $ and $\hat R\ket{u} \in Tu \subset \mathcal{H'}$.

    Given symmetry transformation $T$, the construction of compatible operator begins with the element $\ket{e} \in \mathcal{H}$ and its image $\ket{e'} \in T e \subset \mathcal{H'}$. Consider $\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{P'}$ are orthogonal complements of $\ket{e}, \ket{e'}$, then any vector $\ket{\psi} \in \mathcal{H}$ can be written as
    
    $$
    \ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{e} + \|\ket{u}\| \frac {\ket{u}} {\|\ket{u}\|} \ ; \ \ket{u}\in\mathcal{P}.
    $$

    where $\alpha = \braket{e|\psi}$. Such decomposition works also for $\ket{\psi'}\in\mathcal{H'}$ and $\ket{e'}$. Note that $\ket{u}$ may not be normalized, and $\|\ket{u}\| = \sqrt{\braket{u|u}}$.

    The construction of $\hat V$ begin with assuming $\hat V\ket{e} = \ket{e'}$. By the definition, we have $e' \in T e$. Then generally for $\psi \in \mathcal{H}$, by the lemma (noticing $\{\ket{e}, \ket{u}/\|\ket{u}\|\}$ forms a orthonormal basis in a two-dimensional subspace), we require the image $\hat V\ket{\psi}$ should satisfy

    $$
    \psi' \in T\psi \rightarrow \ket{\psi'} = \hat V\ket{\psi} = \alpha' \ket{e'} + \mu' \frac {\ket{u'}} {\|\ket{u'}\|} =\alpha'\ket{e'} + \hat R\ket{u},
    $$

    in which $|\alpha'| = |\alpha|$ and $|\mu'| = \|\ket{u}\|$. We denote $\hat R\ket{u} = \mu'\ket{u'} / \|\ket{u'}\|$. This equation gives us the fact that $\psi'\in T\psi \Rightarrow \hat R\ket{u} \in Tu$



The proof of Wigner's theorem can then be formally stated.

Now let us consider the higher dimensional case. We can first construct such $\hat V$ for $2\leq \dim \mathcal{H}=N\lt \infty$, i.e., finite dimensional case. In this case, we can always find a set of orthonormal basis $\{\ket{\psi_i}\}_{i=1}^N$ for $\mathcal{H}$. The image of unit rays generated by them under $T$ could used to construct the orthonormal basis of $\mathcal{H'}$ since

$$
|\braket{\psi'_i|\psi'_j}| = |(\psi'_i,\psi'_j)| = |(T\psi_i, T\psi_j)| = |(\psi_i,\psi_j)| = \delta_{ij}.
$$

The following theorem support us to construct $\hat V$ by such basis transformation:



With this lemma, we can construct $\hat V$ in a explicit way:

$$
\hat V = 
$$



For the orthonormal basis $\{\ket{\psi_i}\}$ for $\mathcal{H}$, the image of the unit rays generated by them under symmetry transformation $T$ could also induce a set of orthonormal basis for $\mathcal{H'}$. By $\psi_i' = \{e^{\ti\alpha} \ket{\psi'}: \alpha\in\mathbb{R}\} = T \{e^{\ti \alpha} \ket{\psi}: \alpha \in \mathbb{R}\} = T\psi_i$, it requires

$$
|(\psi'_{i}, \psi' _{j})|^2 = |(T\psi_i, T\psi_j)|^2 = |(\psi_i,\psi_j)|^2 = \delta_{ij}
$$

Now let us consider the operator $\hat V$ compatible with $T$. By the definition, it requires $\forall \ket{v}\in \psi \rightarrow \hat V\ket{v} \in T\psi$. We need to prove any $\hat V$ has the following properties:
1.  (anti-)Linearity: $\hat V (\alpha\ket{a}+\beta\ket{b}) = \chi(\alpha)\hat V\ket{a} + \chi(\beta)\hat V\ket{b}$
2.  Inner product preserving: $(\hat V\ket{a}, \hat V\ket{b}) = \chi((\ket{a},\ket{b})$

in which the function $\chi$ is identity or conjugation.

For $\dim\mathcal{H} = 1$, the problem is trivial. 

Thus, we define the operator $\hat U_T$ by the following relations

$$
\hat U_T \ket{\psi_i} = \ket{\psi'_i}
$$

If $\hat U_T$ is unitary, the
